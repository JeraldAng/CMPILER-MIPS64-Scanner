# Scanner Test Case 
This project aims to create my own lexical analyzer for recognizing valid tokens, following the lexical rules of MIPS64, a reduced instruction set for CPU.

# Running the program
The program created makes use of the Java programming language. No UI has been implemented yet and must be executed in an IDE. <br>

The <b>steps</b> to be able to run the code are as follows:
1. Download the repository onto a computing device. 
2. Open the project in a compatible Java IDE (recommended: IntelliJ).
3. Run the program once the IDE fully loads.
<br>
<b>The entry class file (where the main function is located) is named:</b><br>
LexicalAnalyzer in the src -> LexicalAnalyzer.java file <br>

<b>To change the input:</b><br>
The program read a file called "input.txt" located in the main directory. Simply change the contents of this file to process a new input. To check the output of the file, the "output.txt" in the same directory stores the result computed by the program. Coding-wise, these are found in lines 113 and 100 of the LexicalAnalyzer.java file respectfully.
